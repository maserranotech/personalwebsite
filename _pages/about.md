Hi, my name is Miguel Serrano and I'm a Software Engineer. I like learning new things, being creative and enjoying every moment. From the sound of mechanical keyboards to the sound of birds chirping in the early morning. I try and enjoy the little things as they are what life is made of. One of my favorite things is to take long drives while listening to an awesome playlist, this gives me time to think.

*Time to think*

Deftones, Tool, APC, and Bones... Ah yes, that is what life is made of.

The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. Thereâ€™ll be no one to stop us this time!
